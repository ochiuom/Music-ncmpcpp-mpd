# To make ncmpcpp in working condition using mpd daemon, it could be nightmare and at some point you might give up! Here, are the  guidelines to make it working
#perfectly without any hassle.
#Step by Step process -
#======================================================================================================================================
1. sudo pacman –S ncmpcpp mpd mpc
2. sudo pacman –S  --needed acpi alsa-utils pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa
3. After installation, copy the content of mpd.config file (attached with this repo) to the existing file @.config/mpd/mpd.conf; and make sure that there is no repeated commands
4. copy the content of ncmpcpp_config file (attached with this repo) to the existing file @.config/ncmpcpp/config; and make sure that there is no repeated commands
5. mpc update
6. ncmpcpp
#======================================================================================================================================
#One thing, sometimes you would be facing is that everything was okay before restarting the system and now ncmpcpp showing connection refused, that probably mpd daemon
#was not stopped/killed properly. Don’t worry either kill the mpd daemon using PID manually or boot the operating system.

#Here, I used /sdcard/Music/ for my S21 phone where all the music files are stored locally. Make sure that music file location for ncmpcpp and mpd config file remain same. 

#Special case for Android Phone:

#7. In this case you need to pipe/tunnel the sound from Android system to Proot Container where the Arch Linux system is installed. Just run the below command on termux
before entering into Linux system or make a termux widget for the command

pulseaudio --start --load="module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1 auth-anonymous=1" --exit-idle-time=-1s
